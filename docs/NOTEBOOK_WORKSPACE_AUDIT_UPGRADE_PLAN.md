### Pre-N1 gaps (from audit + screenshot)

1. **Viewport:** `isMobile = width < 1024` → tablets forced into phone tabs (no true tablet layout).  
2. **PDF strip:** thumbs often non-navigating (`onSelectPage` not wired from notebook). Touch targets small (~44×56 CSS px).  
3. **Context drift:** banner can show stale concept (e.g. Philosophy) while course is Microeconomics when `openStudyWorkspace()` clears override without anchoring course topic.  
4. **Typography:** `--type-micro` = 10px; mobile tab labels `text-[10px]`.  
5. **Studio density:** fixed `grid-cols-2` even on wide studio / tablet.  
6. **Library topics:** L1 already opens workspace — must keep concept sync (N1).

- Quick-action wrap + loading states durable.  
- Active studio card visible state (Compare highlight durable).

### OPT-N3 — Sources integrity
- Multi-source pin/order; thumbnail reprocess; empty demo seed.  
- Source check deep-link; quality strip always actionable.

### OPT-N4 — Demo sandbox completeness
- Every studio card + quick action works on demo Microeconomics.  
- Context never cross-contaminates Philosophy/other courses.

### OPT-N5 — Verification
- Matrix phone/tablet/desktop × Minimal/Blueprint.  
- Playwright: topic→workspace concept; PDF page; studio open.
